## ATS Scoring System

The ATS analyzer evaluates resumes on five key components:

1. **Keyword Optimization (25%)** - Relevance and density of industry keywords
2. **Format Compliance (20%)** - File format, length, and structure adherence
3. **Structure (20%)** - Organization, section headers, and chronological order
4. **Content Quality (20%)** - Quantified achievements and action verbs
5. **Completeness (15%)** - Essential information and section completeness

## Tips for Better ATS Performance

- Use standard section headers (Experience, Education, Skills)
- Include relevant keywords from job descriptions
- Quantify achievements with specific numbers and percentages
- Use bullet points for better readability
- Keep resume length between 300-700 words
- Avoid graphics, tables, or complex formatting
- Use standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)
- Save as PDF or DOCX format
